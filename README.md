# Vue Examples

In this repo you'll see many branches, each used to show various ways Vue can be used.

I'm working with a very basic setup of Vue with Vuex and Vue Router, but no tests. You can create this setup yourself using the Vue CLI.

## To get started:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/patrickodacre/vue-examples.git vue-examples

cd vue-examples

git checkout <desired branch>

npm install

npm run serve
```
